# Lesson 7.5 Exit Ticket
### Data Manipulation w/ SQL

## Directions
We will be analyzing data from a large sample data set. Download and **import** the SQL dumps for the [database schema](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila/blob/master/pagila-schema.sql) and the [data insertion](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila/blob/master/pagila-insert-data.sql).

For the following exercises, we will be using the `film_list` table. In the SQL file included in this repo, write your responses to the following exercises:

  1. Write a query that returns the total number of films in our table.
  2. Write a query that returns the title and descriptions of the ten films with the longest descriptions.
  3. Write a query that returns the shortest movie, by length.
  4. Write a query that returns title and description of all of the films that feature `"CAMERON STREEP"`.
  5. Write a query that returns all of the film `genre`s along with their average price and average length.
  6. Write a query that returns all of the film `ratings`s along with a count of how many time that rating appears in our table.
  7. Instead of us calling films "foreign," write a query that updates all "foreign" films to "international" films.
  8. We don't like "childrens" films. Delete all of them from this table.
